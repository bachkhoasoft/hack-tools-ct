 You can see how many hops it takes to get to another Internet host by using the Trace utilities. <br>

<font color="#00E0FF"><b>IP address</b></font> - 
 the Internet Protocol address is a unique number that is used to represent every single computer or device on a TCP/IP network.
 The format of an IP address is a 32-bit numeric address written as four numbers separated by periods. Each number can be zero to 255 (for example, 192.223.56.12 could be an IP address). <br>
 Within an isolated network, you can assign IP addresses at random as long as each one is unique. However, connecting a private network to the Internet requires using registered IP addresses (called Internet addresses) to avoid duplicates. <br>
 The four numbers in an IP address are used in different ways to identify a particular network and a host on that network. The InterNIC Registration Service assigns Internet addresses from the following three classes. <br>
 Class A - supports 16 million hosts on each of 127 networks <br>
 Class B - supports 65,000 hosts on each of 16,000 networks <br>
 Class C - supports 254 hosts on each of 2 million networks <br>
 The number of unassigned Internet addresses is running out, so a new classless scheme called CIDR is gradually replacing the system based on classes A, B, and C and is tied to adoption of IPv6.<br><br>

  assigned by the operating system when there is a request for service. Port
  numbers for server applications are preassigned by the IANA 
  (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) and do not change.
