People have emailed me about DoS not loading for them
with a "Permissions denied" error. The reason DoS is
giving you this error, is becuase DoS has an Internet
cache cleaning engine built into it. While DoS was trying
to clean your cache files, there was a file in your cache
that refuses to be deleted, and thus forcing DoS to crash.

You need to update your anti virus software and scan
your system with your anti virus, and also an upto date
adware/spyware removal tool.


This is also the reason DoS may take time to load...
If you want DoS to load faster, open task manager.
Locate DoS in the priority tab and right click on DoS
select Priority, and select "Highest" then once DoS loads
reset it back to Normal.
