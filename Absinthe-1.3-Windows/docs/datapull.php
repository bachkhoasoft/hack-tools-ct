		<h1>Pulling Records from the Database</h1>
		Once you have downloaded at least part of the schema, you can begin to pull records from the database.
		<br /><br />
		<div align="center">
			<img src="fullwindow3.png" />
		</div>
		<br />

		Simply select the local filename of the XML file you would like to save the data to, either by typing it in or by hitting the <b><i>Browse</i></b>
		button. After you have chosen a destination file, you will have to select which fields you would like to pull from the database. Select the fields
		you would like to retrieve from the left side and click the <b><i>Add</i></b> button. You can pull records from multiple tables, just select all the
		data you're interested in retrieving. <br />
		Once you have selected everything, click the <b><i>Download Fields to XML</i></b> button. This process should take a substantial amount of time to 
		finish, so you should probably go make a cup of coffee or fill out some TPS reports. But the great thing is, you don't have to sit there and type 
		all of this manually!
