 		     Absinthe - Automated Blind SQL Injection

Absinthe 1.3 (Absinthe behind closed doors...)

Absinthe was designed to automate the process of exploiting blind SQL 
injection holes on Microsoft SQL Server. It currently supports SQL 
Server, Oracle and Postgres. It will not find the holes for you, it will 
simply reduce the time for a meaningful penetration. 

If you have any questions or comments on the tool, please do not hesitate
to visit http://www.0x90.org/releases/absinthe or email us at: 
absinthe@0x90.org

An HTML user guide is available at:
http://www.0x90.org/releases/absinthe/docs

This release of Absinthe was originally made for Blackhat Asia 2005.
It includes Basic, Digest and NTLM authentication.

I've included a compiled version for straight install which includes my
custom wx.NET DLLs required for Absinthe. 

To install these, just run install.sh

If you'd rather recompile it yourself, you'll need to follow these steps:

	o  Download the source for wxWidgets and wx.NET from http://wxwidgets.org
	   and http://wxnet.sf.net 
	o  Apply the patch to Object.cs available in the tarball or
	   from http://www.0x90.org/~nummish/wx/Object.cs.patch
	o  Build wx.NET as per the instructions on their website
	o  Modify the Makefile in ./wx to point to your installation of wx.NET.dll
	o  run the Makefile in the root directory. 
 
From this point, you can just run the install script as normal. 

Hopefully you find this useful.
