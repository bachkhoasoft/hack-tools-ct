# VERSION 1.0 (18 Applications)
# coded by Douglas weaknetlabs@gmail.com

# 06.01.12
Changed Suite name to pWeb Suite
Created Google Code Page and now all changes will be documented there.

# 03.10.12
filephish is now fileScope and does a recursive search,
code is smaller and more efficient and now takesfile types
argument.

# 03.09.12
Added smsi (SimplyMySQLi) MySQL injection tool.
Added branding to strEncode and usage
Added more funcationality to strEncode:
	URL String Decode;
	ASCII String encode; (for magic quotes: backslashes(PHP))

# 02.01.2012
Created the XSS StringEnc.pl appication for encoding actual programming code to be used 
in cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. Could be used for RFi also.

# 10.01.2011
During the creation of the video demo for the suite, i noticeed some things
wrong and fixed them. md5cracker is gone (useless tool)
and a few other tweaks on files.

# 09.24.2011
Modified RePsychoLoop to take "HEX" as an argument.

# 09.23.2011
Remodeled RePsychoLoop using hashes for double the speed (check "time") against hashes
	and arrays (ordered lists) in Perl. This version creates a double hash and 
	appends it based on the user inpuut for "depth"

# 09.17.2011
Added "RePsychoLoop" which is a word / character concatenator. works with word lists
	to defeat the "use 4 random words" article on xkcd. Also works as a "Cruch" (c)
	clone.

# 09.14.2011
Added Havijmd5BF application to test md5's found via SQLi using online resources.
	logs to "logs/Havijmd5BF/" directory. Somply pass it a "Havij Report" HTML file
	as an argument.

Powered up HelLFiRE and made it smarter! :D calling the new version LogInject0r
	Both are different, if you can't find / write to the log files then use 
	the brute forcer - HelLFiRE! LogInject0r actually spoofs a USER AGENT and
	injects code into the HTTP log file. Then, it calls the log file and finds
	files in /etc/ Next, it actually goes through each file and saves it to the
	attackers system. :) Automagic.

# 09.13.11
remodeled pBincracker to log all successful cracks in ../logs/pBin/<pasteBin ID>
	made pBincracker smarter by not attempting hashes more than once.

# 09.12.11
added dirBF a directory brute force application for non-indexable sites
	which uses a simple wordlist.
added "recon" directory. now all scan logs will be located in
	"scans" in the pCrack Suite's root directory.
added HOST UP detection to dirBF
added HOST UP detection to HelLFiRE
cleaned up root directory and made more directories
updated README for "webapps"
dirBF became filephish and can phish for *any* files not just
	directories.
filephish now shows (possible) lfi/rfi/sqli vulnerable files found

# 09.10.11 (PM)
added 404/50X error handling for HelLFiRE
added better logging which creates a <DOMAIN>/scan_log.txt file to HelLFiRE
organized better output and added timestamps for HTTP requests to HelLFiRE
added USER AGENT support for those pesky sites that check for it
	in our curl requests for HelLFiRE.

# 09.10.11 (AM)
completed HelLFiRE
added a pastebin cracker for RAW MD5 hashes 
	posted from pastebinleaks on Twitter,
	or CrackMeIfYouCan
Added some love and got severly drunk as hell. so much

# 08.31.11
Added LFi Scanner - well started it anyways.

# 08.05.11
Added second resource for ./online-resources/md5online
Added help and error checking to ./md5cracker
Added yet another resource to ./online-resources/md5online
Added Google as resource for ./online-resources/md5online
Got drunk.
