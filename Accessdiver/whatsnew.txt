Version of Accessdiver appeared in this order:
Note that v4.100 is not v4.1, nor v4.120 isn't v4.12.
first release was v4.0. Then there was v4.1, ...,v4.9,4.97, v4.100,..., v4.171.


-----------------------------------------------------------

What's new in v4.171    June-19th-2005
====================

- Fixed an init bug in the HTML/FORM BOT engine, which wasn't initialized as intended. That's why it never
  started as intended in early version 4.170!

- HTTP Debugger: Possibility to store HTML results into a files. When clicking the [Result] button a popup
  menu will appear showing you all options available.

- The FORM BOT bug was fixed in June 1st 2005. I have made 2 other fixup in mid-february, but I forgot which
  they were since I didn't write them down onto my to-do list. Sorry for no precision on this... People who
  reported those bugs surely will know. :-)


-----------------------------------------------------------

What's new in v4.170    December-27h-2004
====================

As you have surely seen, all releases, after 4.130, tended to freeze more or less. Most freezing version
was final 4.160. I took time to make sure the new release 4.170 will be up and running has it is intended
to be, before announcing a new release. That took more than one month betatesting with willing guys. Thanks
to them :) We've been able to eradicate most bad stuffs, and now AD is even scanning faster than before.
Here is the list of new things in 4.170 :

1) Fixed a bug which could enter an endless loop when facing #0 replies. Mostly due to IDLE proxies.

2) Added a detection of disfunctionnal proxies (=IDLE proxies) in proxy analyzer

3) Ability to remove IDLE proxies from the analyzer list automatically

4) In progression, you can see amount of usable proxies (from the green stats area)

5) Fixed the FAKE Proxy false error introduced since 4.160.

6) Bug in proxy analyzer fixed when making selected proxies the default MYList. Not all proxies were added.

7) Fixed a bug with Cookies collecting in BOT kernel. Could lead to an AccessViolation.

8) Added PAUSE handling while working on HTML scanning.

9) Ability now to run more than one session of AccessDiver for doing your tests. That was impossible if 2
   tests were run at the same time (only possible in v4.130 and lower). Warning: The http error LOG system
   (2xx_log.ini ,etc..) won't be accessible if not run from the first AccessDiver instance!

10) Proxy Hunter methodology reviewed from scratch. That should eradicate all or at least most bugs related
    to that feature. The system will now run faster and will detect more proxies. :-))

11) BOT retries were damn slow since 4.160, since everything was retried 3 times. So 4 attempts could occur
    for each user:pass tried.

12) Ability to set the amount of BOT retries. (Default=2 attempts). You can set it from the settings\access
    TAB. Reduce it to 1 time, for faster scans, if you wish. But this will make analysis less accurate (enough
    good anyway). :-)

13) Bug fixed within HTML/FORM scanner when relaunching a timed-out BOT.

14) History/Serverfailure Found: "Delete selection" popup menu wasn't operationnal. Just fixed!


   
-----------------------------------------------------------

What's new in v4.160	November-9th-2004   ( LOT OF BUGS FIXED BUT UNSTABLE RELEASE :-(( )
====================

1) Fixed Beep bug when working with clipboard. That option was always re-enabled when relaunching AD.

2) A bug fix in FORM detection, when collection new cookies. Cookie Path data always inserted. :-(

3) Crashing Bug fixed when not using any proxy: occured during scans for basic-authentication and FORM/HTML

4) Forgot to remove some debug data in last 4 releases about FORM scanning (Oops). "c:\....\cache\FORMTEMP.TXT"
   That could slow down or crash the test when using too many bots...

5) When a Redirection was found, and option was set to be redir=weak login, the redirs tab (in progression)
   wasn't updated.

6) Bug when recalling a snapshot, some settings weren't correctly updated and some weren't saved in snapshot!!!

7) Ability to tell if redirection must be followed. (default=enabled). Disable this feature if you only know
   what you are doing. Since the software will only tell it got a redirection, but won't give the real url it
   goes to. That can be bad mostly with FORM scanning...

8) Clicking the Servers reply count zone in progression tab will open its replies log directory. Works only
   when the scan is over.

9) Ability to specify your real IP in the proxy analyzer. Mostly for people under gateways,routers.

10) Bad Bug found in the HTML FORM scanner when dealing with redirections. Bad url was handled.

11) Found another bad bug with FORM scanner. In some cases (many times) the startup of FORM could enter a loophole
    which would kill AD...

12) V4.140 to 4.152 didn't catch the real redirection correctly due to Redirection following always set to OFF. Now
    by default redirection are always followed.

13) Bugs fixed in timeout handling of the FORM scanner.

14) In standard scanner (popup security) timeouts handling showed invalid timeout messages in some cases. bug fixed

15) Added an option in proxies MYLIST, to let you tell if proxy skipping should occur when a bot timed out. In earlier
    versions, proxies were always skipped on timeouts (in POPUP scanning mode). That could lead to killing proxy too
    fast... That option fixes and enhances the process of proxy management.

16) Bug fixed in History when copying FORM hits into clipboard. Extras data weren't stored.

17) Fixed a visual bug when reloading a wordlist from a snapshot. Last used combos parts were still visible.

18) Special case handling on #10061 return codes, that means proxy can be saturated of requests. So we don't need to
    skip it systematically. This update will make your proxies lifetime much longer... :-))

19) Added in progression, a new log file. It will contain all combos involved within a Fake test. This way you'll be
    able to relaunch those logins by saving them to a new combo file.

20) Added a new stats panel at bottom-right of the progression panel. It merges all information already shown by AD, but
    to one area. You'll have also stats to know how many combos were lost, and proxy traffic issues stat...

21) Proxy Analyzer: #10061/#10060 are retried once before saying the proxy is unusable... That gives more chance to have
    extra valid proxies...

22) To make better catch of weak login, bots are now retried once more in case of proxy/timeout troubles. this will
    slower the scan a bit but for more safety. :)

23) Same update as (22) done within the proxy analyzer

24) Same update as (22) done in SOCKS analyzer

25) Bug in proxy analyzer. When a bot was retried, it always sent an HEAD command. So if using GET, that could false your
    results.

26) Bug fix when testing a redirection URL through the proxy analyzer/special tab

27) Fixed a bug within the "FORM ACTION=" parser. Sometimes the url was detected has from the root instead from a local url.

28) For those who are bored clicking too much to detect FORM PostData, simply press Ctrl+H to start the test from anywhere.

29) Now clicking on the name of a wordlist in "dictionary/currently used" will open this file into a text editor. That's
    cool when you want to add/delete new entry in your list.

30) Right-clicking the link told in (29) will reload the wordlist.

31) Proxy analyzer updated to detect FAKE proxies. Works only when special mode "Password-protected URL" is disabled.

32) New button in HTTP debugger. It's a button to collect cookies used by a site (from IE cookies cache). Cookies will only be
    collected if you have already visited the site from Internet Explorer!!!

33) HTTP debugger can now be set with white background. Simply double-click the window to apply color changes. 

34) I preffer to rewrite FORM/HTML Bot kernel from scratch since it was hard to fix things up. You'll get more stabilities now.

35) In redirection modes, added "Assume redirections are failures" that's good to make difference from a FAKE and a FAILURE.

36) "Stop on Fakes" handling didn't work correctly on FORM scanning... Fixed!!!

37) Fixed a bug in the URL parser when path is void...

38) Added FAKE Proxy deletion in proxyanalyzer context-menu and in remover button.

39) Cookie handling/catching enhanced in basic-authentication and FORM bots...

40) Fixed the [+] button in URL history which was disabled in most cases. So it wasn't possible to add new urls manualy until now.

41) Another button was disabled: the removal button in proxy analyzer. it was anoying to reenable it. just fixed.

42) Option removed from the progression tab. the one called "[x]Don't hide this section after a test completion". The progression
    tab will now always be visible after any test...

43) Fixed a recall snapshot bug when the reloaded wordlist doesn't exist. That bug made loading of future combos impossible.

44) Fixed a bug within the Autopilot "Skip job on error" module. It mostly always stop a job when not required. uhh

45) In Basic-authentication scanning, reply #0 are now considered as bad replies, instead of being retried again when detected.
    this allows faster scanning. Same for socket errors (Error above #10000).

46) Old bug fixed in Settings\Search\WhatToDoWithFoundLogin\AddInFile . Nothing was saved in fact.

47) Added in taskbar information of currently run task. Example of info shown:  100% 0/0 /0 /0. Percentage indicates were in the
    scanning the software is. 2nd value counts the amount of weak logins found. 3rd value counts the amount of fake detected.
    4th value counts the amount of usable proxies left. last value counts the number of bots retried since the beginning... This
    system help you to see where AD task by a blink of an eye... :)



-----------------------------------------------------------

What's new in v4.152	September-06th-2004
====================

1) Bug fixed with the "[x] Set Cookie" parameter in Setting/HTML settings. That cookie and the collected ones
   were never sent back during the test... This seems to occur since v4.110 at least... That fixup will make
   the software handles "cookie-sensitive" servers better...

2) Visual fixup in Snapshot list, for a better view of everything.

3) Proxy leecher: added a test to avoid testing invalid urls. Can cause crashes sometimes.

4) Same for the Word Leecher.


 4.151 has been available for a day : Sep-04. But I didn't announce it to all users, for 2 reasons.

    1) The points (1) and (2) in v4.152 release were only made. I wanted to finish point (3)/(4)
       to really announce something. And there it is.

    2) After the echoes I've had from some of you, I wanted to provide 3 different versions of
       Accessdiver. Here they are:

    v1) A zipped version is available, just to download the real update, and nothing more.

    v2) A full installer WITHOUT any bundles (third-party applications), to people who just
        want to install AccessDiver for the first time, without additional contents.

    v3) A version with bundled applications (by WhenU) for people who don't mind adding additional
        softwares, and at the same time, helps the author of AccessDiver.

  So you have the choice now to download really what you want... :-)



-----------------------------------------------------------

What's new in v4.150	August-13th-2004
====================

1)  HTTP engine updated (new parsing method + little fixups). Some BOT results were false in v4.141. :-(
    These changes makes things working smoothly now...

2)  Fixed bug when exiting the application. It could showed "Cannot locate the application...".

3)  Added a system which will log every attempt made by AccessDiver http bots. The proxy and user:pass will
    be saved to file. 11 files will be generated, each for the replycode category. 2XX.log/403.log/etc...All
    datas will be stored in the "c:\programfiles\AccessDiver\Cache\CodeLog" directory of the software. Click
    on the Progression \ [Menu] button to open this directory. This allows you to see in details, attempts
    sorted by replies (all combos returned 2xx codes, all combos detected during fakes, 403 ones, etc...)
    This will assist you to track weak logins better. Note: Disabled during auto-pilot!!!

4)  New!!! A registry patching will take effect on the first run of AccessDiver. This correction reenables
    Internet Explorer so that it will allow openning of urls like http://user:pass@site.com... :-) This
    patch is not dangerous to your computer, it's just a flag that tells IE to allow those kind of urls
    once again. :-) It's better quitting all IE instances before running v4.150. Thanks to Dan "Ivac"...

5)  Alert "can't reset list" when installing AD for the first time won't be shown again...

6)  Added in AccessDiver's installer package, 3 freeware tools made by WhenU. It has a Weathercast report
    for you own local area. It includes an atomic clock synchronizer, and finally a web search bar...
    Please suppot the author of AccessDiver by installing this WhenU toolkit. It's completly free for you.
    Thank you!!!!!

7)  Ability to store leeched proxies directly into a file instead of adding them in memory. See in the
    \Options tab of the ProxyLeecher to enable it. It allows you to add proxies to an existing file or
    into a new file... Note: This function doesn't remove duplicated proxies. It doesn't collect datas
    in Accessdiver neither. Leeches from clipboard are not store to file but always in memory...

8)  Ability to store leeched combos into a file. Same feature as the new proxy leecher ability...
    note: I'll possibly add in a future version, this system for the leeched urls...

9)  ProxyLeecher now auto-unticks invalid urls, so they won't be used anymore... Same for ComboLeecher!

10) HTTP Debugger: Now shows the HTTP header to be sent. Helps for better debugging...

11) HTTP Debugger: Bug when entering a path in the Header section, instead of a full URL. leads nowhere!!!

12) HTTP Debugger: Bug when adding your own Headers. Some of those header were changed to default
    debugger values.

13) HTTP Debugger: Some requests weren't sent sometimes, but cached ones were used instead. That
    could false the results. Now it's really okay :-)))

14) HTTP Debugger: Visual fixup on Headers information. Text was always shown twice.

15) In Word Leecher, added HTTP referer info, since some leech site need that info.

16) Added HTTP referer info for ProxyLeecher too.

17) Fixup done when a bot is forced to skip to next proxy during a fake detection. Methodoly enhanced too!

18) Some fixups in fake detection steps. This leads to a better and faster fake detection. :-)



-----------------------------------------------------------

What's new in v4.141	August-05th-2004
====================

1) Bug fixed when adding a ProxyJudge url in the PJ list. Index-out-of-bound[0] occured just
   after using it...

2) Bug in some cases with the proxyGateway detector. It could falsely say that a proxy gateways
   to itself... Those ones will be tagged as "OK - it seems to work", now...

3) Socket kernel updated...

   Note: Some of you reported problem with Accessdiver and other similar softwares
         (Sentry,AATools...). This release doesn't fix that trouble, since it's not
         AD related...Symptoms are that site name can be pinged and resolved, but no packet
         can be sent to connect to the site of your choices...
         Try WinsockXPFix to correct that annoying trouble. You can find a copy from my site or
         on the internet:   http://www.accessdiver.com/download/winsockxpfix.zip


-----------------------------------------------------------

What's new in v4.140	July-05th-2004
====================

1) Fixed a bug within debugger when using your own HTTP header set

2) Updated the HTTP kernel (minor update for faster parsing)

3) Enhanced the FORM detection again for more cases.

4) Fixed a bad bug within the History Refresher. Some results were said down incorrectly.
   uhhh!!!!!

5) Added a feature to let you choose your own navigator when opening an url. This skips
   false results when using patched InternetExplorer 6.0x version. You're welcome to use
   another navigator, than IE, when checking passwords with AccessDiver... This feature
   is available in the "Settings\Extras" tab.

6) Interfacing system with GeoWhere is now set to disabled by default (User suggestion).
   Since that feature erases clipboard content for each weak login found... You must disable
   this feature by your own, if it's not the first time you've install AccessDiver.  Go to
   History/WeakLogins/GeowhereTransfer/StoreResults and untick all options there...

7) Bug fixed in HTTP kernel which could lead to false '301 moved' replies.



-----------------------------------------------------------

What's new in v4.130 Autumn 2003 Edition
==================== Sunday November-30th-2003

1) Proxy Analyzer: Possibility to do proxy test with a URL referrer

2) Proxy Analyzer: You can now do proxy testing via GET method

3) Proxy Analyzer: Dangerous proxy removal now on .MIL and .GOV proxies

4) FORM Security engine: Ability to set your own specific cookies

5) Bug fixed for URL validation on scripted urls. Extra char "/" added wrongly sometimes

6) Redirection manager enhanced Now you can set 3 cases of subdirectory detection
    at the same time.  Takes actions based on keywords to detect in subdirs.

7.a) New fake engine added : "Keyword hit" fake detection. That engine is different to the one used
    in AccessDiver. Keyword test will be done on data received for every 200-OK reply. You can also
    do keyword testing whatever errorcode was received.

7.b) "Keyword failure" fake detection also incorporated...

8) HTTP debugger : now shows header info on top of the body data (yellow txt). It's more accurate
    to read, mostly for cookies tracking or redirections reading...

9) AD now can catch non-standard HTTP redirections and replies. That will make easier to detect
   bizarre server replies...

10) Bug fixed with Skip proxy on FORM keyword detection. it was always enabled during test :-(.

11) bug fixed in FORM system when detecting keywords. There was zero boundaries test done...

12) I did other small fixes, but I haven't write them in my to-do list... So no description available
    for them...

13) FORM Manual detection of datas enhanced and bugs fixed within it...

14) Ability to choose which FORM to use if there are more than one FORM section in a web page.

15) Auto-detection of POST data in settings now allows you to choose which form to detect, when dealing
     with multiple forms...

16) To help you in POST data detection for HTML testing, if a cookie is detected, the software will warn you
      to use it...Since it can be necessary to set a cookie to go further...

17) Possibility to retry a login from the progression tab immediatly in the HTTP debugger. This can be a good
      way to track extra page you missed. Mostly for the new FAKE detector (based on keywords).

18) Bug fixed within bots. Some test were done with an empty "Accept-Language" HTTP command. Some server can be
    sensible to that...




    NOTE: a) Not included in this version, due to a lack of time : Ability to skip proxies on Timeout
             (mostly usefull for FORM). Soon

          b) This release 4.130 comes bundled with a freeware to detect spywares; it is called SPYBAN
             This software will be launched automatically once you'll quit Accessdiver for the first time.
             Then it won't be called again. An icon will be placed on your desktop thenafter to reuse it. :)
	         Thanks for giving it a try!!!

	      c) A lite version 4.130 now exists. It uses very less resources, but consider it as a beta release
	         since not all test were done on it. But it should work okay I think... Go to the main page of
	         AccessDiver to get your copy of it. No proxy/socks analyzing/ no leeching / no extratools. Simply
	         security testing is available  :)

          d) I won't be joinable during this coming weeks since I'm taking a long computer break. I'll be back
             in 2004 with fresh air in mind :-)

          e) Special greetings to Peterccc2000 and Larenzo for their betatesting assistance in 4.130 release...

          f) Thank you for using AccessDiver!!!




-----------------------------------------------------------

What's new in v4.120 Summer 2003 Edition
==================== Monday August-11th-2003

1) Better 2XX handling. Mostly for 202 cases

2) ExtrasTools\File splitter: ZERO byte file bug when using "Make chunks" option

3) Fakes and redirections are now separated in the progression tab. So added a new sub-tab for fakes

4) Proxy black list bug fixed: Adding proxies from clipboard

5) Proxy black list bug fixed: Adding proxies from a file

6) Exploiter: Show the exact amount of possible failures as a stat

7) Exploiter: Now you can load and add exploits like : ":port/dir"

8) Exploiter: added a new case: "404 are hits"

9) Exploiter couldn't handle correctly urls with a port other than 80 (fixed)

10) Snapshot loading/saving bug fixed: missing some exploiting options to reactivate

11) ExtrasTools\File splitter: Bug when dealing with long file names (incorrect returns in lines)

12) Fakes and redirs are now put on top of lists from the progression tab...

13) Added new clearing options in the \progression\MENU button.

14) Debugger: Fixed a problem in the manual HEADER inputs section.

15) Debugger: Added a test to avoid endless loops on some certain redirs

16) Bug fixed when lines were too long in header list

17) Visual bug: In "List of used urls"Clipboard button was invisible

18) ExtrasTools\FileSplitter: File merger was buggy

19) Added a data block extractor system in ExtrasTools\Filesplitter section... uhhh, I don't remember
    if it has already been introduced in v4.113...

20) Visual bug when dealing with the small 2 buttons at right of the web server area (search/navigate
    buttons). On https urls, these button were off when relaunching AD.. Note anyway that AD doesn't do https

21) Fixed a bug in FORM scanning which could lead to incorrect hits when dealing with dead proxies.

22) HTTPDebugger: When opening a url in navigator, possibility to specify your cookies before 
    navigating (right-click)

23) Fixed bug with the [Search the web] feature.

24) Fake detector enhanced with a more realistic method...

25) More accurate Timeout system. Logical bug fixed at low-level socket... So less false timeouts...

26) Better multiple-FORM detection in HTTPdebugger. (not 100% finished)

27) Added a [Refresh] button in Wordlist manager for those who change their wordlist content oftenly.

28) For better JOB handling, "Unamed Wordlist" are automatically renamed to the filename of the combo...

29) Serious bug with HTML pattern detection due to bug when storing to disc. Fixed

30) The button [View] in Progression (for FORM scanning) now opens one menu for multiple pages. 
    Less resources used :)

31) Double-clicking the progression/Bots list opens a user:pass in your navigator. (Handy but doesn't 
    handle FORMs yet)

32) Proxy skipping now doesn't affect a bot when it is in FAKE detection mode. It could happen a bot 
    drops FAKE detection due to proxy skipping...

33) Proxy information added in HTTP debugger view...And incorrect IP info fixed...

34) ReplyCode=#0 treated specially in FORM and Basic authentication scanning... This should produce
    more accurate results...

35) Added a warning message when you want to do proxy analyzing for FORM/200 detection... Describing
    fake proxies trouble...

36) Exporting Weak history to Big text format (Shift+F4) didn't save expired ones . Fixed

37) Fixed the msg alert "Can't reset AccessDiver's Exploits list" when starting the software...



What's new in v4.113 (3906)  Monday March-17-2003
============================

- Oops, the exploiter system didn't work except in URL mode only. Just fixed.



What's new in v4.112+ (3903)  Monday March-17-2003
============================

- Fixed bad slowdowns problem when removing items in lists. Problem was introduced
  with v4.100 and its XP fixup of the 100%CPU usage.

- Fixed a bug when AD was finishing a security test. It didn't save weak logins 
  to history correcly. Some found logins weren't stored.
  
- Added a new mode in the exploiter. You have ROOT/LOCAL, and now URL. That means
  your exploit can be a site directly, instead of a relative path. It won't do the
  exploiting based on the url of AD, but based on that URL. That can be usefull
  sometimes.
  
- In weak History, when previewing (eye button) an HTML site, it didn't take in
  account the params to enter the address.

- For better HTML form tests, when you manually detect Post Data, the orgin URL
  is automatically used as the refferer URL. It's put in \Settings\Misc\ tab.
  
- Bug fixed when you planned to autosend weaklogins to GeoWhere.




What's new in v4.111 (3859)  Sunday March-07-2003
==========================

- new feature in FORM (HTML) bot engine: ability to avoid using keywords to
  find weak logins. It can now rely on finding redirection only. So it's 
  a bit simpler to handle FORMs.

- HTTP Debugger: * Added a new option to avoid HTML data  to appear (yellow text)
                 * Fixed the annoying design bug that make editors upside down.
                 
- ExtrasTools\File splitter/merger improved. File saving should be at lease 4x faster.

- FORM bot engine: fixed a bug with buffer limit and size improved. Warning:
  memory usage for the HTML form tester has been increased. from 1.4MB to 12MB.
  
- Bug fixed with the FORM bot engine. Empty content replies could block AD.

- Those options weren't saved in proxy analyzer: "slower analysis"," export IP".



What's new in v4.110+ (3833)  Sunday March-02-2003
==========================

- Annoying bug introduced in v4.110 fixed. Found weak logins weren't stored in
  history except if "stored original urls" option was ON.



What's new in v4.110 (3832)  Saturday March-01-2003
==========================

- 100% CPU usage fixup. Should be more stable on WinXP

- Advertising Banner bar removed from AccessDiver. You won't be annoyed by
  it anymore.         Any money donation is welcome - Thank you.
  
- Added a feature in the exploiter : "5XX are hits".

- In ExtraTools/FileSplitter, added a new tool to extract only a part of 
  a file.  I made this for myself in fact but not directly for AD, but to
  extract any area of a divX partially downloaded.
  
- Bug fixed in History/failureFound : * delete selection was unusable / 
				      * Added a confirmation alert on deletion 	

- Bug fixed in Word generator. <RW> on "hello" did "helloolleh" instead of "olleh" 

- You can now change proxy options on the fly. No need to restart a test.

- Fixed a memory leak when starting the word generator process, and fixed a buggy
  handling in the macros.

- Added a feature in HTTP debugger, to send clicked selection in clipboard when
  releasing the mouse clik. As what mirC does.  :)
  
- WeakHistory/Export as TXT/special => crashed. Just fixed

- WeakHistory/Export as Web page => Can't create file. Just fixed

- idem: HTML template extension problem fixed.

- Forget some minor fixed done. oops



What's new in v4.103 (3782)  Friday December-17-2002
==========================

- Bad bug in v4.102. Due to a File saving problem, you could loose your whole 
  parameters and lists, when quitting the software. 

I suggest you to avoid using v4.102. Update to v4.103 or go back to v4.101. v4.103
fixes that bug. :-)



What's new in v4.102 (3782)  Friday December-13-2002
==========================

- Google searching was buggy. No results were found anymore. Just fixed.



What's new in v4.101 (3778)  Friday December-13-2002
==========================

- HTML pattern previewer enhanced. It won't open all pages anymore (resource eating) but
  will open a page will all patterns (as links). :)

- Fixed a delay problem in the temporization code. Not big thingy, but its now more stable.

- Fixed a resource leak in Banners due to an uncleared buffer. It should use less resources.

- Added a button to add the selected redirections into your history from the Progression\Redirs.
  Caution: clicking a line there doesn't launch the url anymore. You'll need to doublclick.



What's new in v4.100 (3747)  Wednesday December-04-2002
==========================

- Fixed the annoying bug when the \Progression\Redirs list was filled with +100 entries. You would get an
  "Index out of bound (-1)" error. This is not a bug from my programming, but due to a library I coding used.

- Fixed the bug that made the "FBI & USArmy proxy" remover unusable since v4.96.

- Added a SEARCH feature in AccessDiver. It collects results from Google and on my sponsor. Please support
  my work by using this feature. Thank you.

- Added a feature for personnal web site owners. If you want extras traffic to your site, there's now a way
  to place your 468x60 GIF banner in AccessDiver. Go to http://www.accessdiver.com/bannerinad.htm for
  more details.



What's new in v4.97 (3679) Saturday November-23-2002
==========================

- Added an feature to add found weak logins into you history when the task isn't finished.
  That has been added in the [Menu] button from the progression tab.

- In the wordlist section, the option "kill words under X letters" was bugy. it killed also entries equals 
  to X letters.

- Added a feature to do history refreshing by using the proxy linked to the url. To enable the option
  go and see in \Settings\Misc. That option isn't automatically saved when quitting due to security reason.

- Added a feature to let you set the Windows Priority of AccessDiver, so you can make it a bit less freezing.
  Option available in Options\Misc.



What's new in v4.96 (3643) Monday November-11-2002
==========================

- Fixed a bug that was here since very old version v2.xx of AccessDiver. It was the one which say
  "Value must be between 0 to 4294000000". This is due to the use of iterative search mode and 
 when wordlists were above 65535 lines.

- Added a macro in Settings \subdir detection. Add <HOMEPAGE> to detect if an attempt leads
  directly to the homepage of the server tried.

- Fixed a bug that could occur rarely but badly. Sometimes AD freezed when testing your proxies.
  This is due to dysfunctionnal proxies (ProxyBombs) that make AccessDiver entering an endless 
  loop. "ProxyBombs" can be not a good term to name those proxies, but they act like bombs on AD.

- "ProxyBombs" detection added in the Standard security tester to avoid a freeze when starting.

- "Proxybombs" detection added in the HTTP Debugger.

- Bug fixed on redirection URL shown in HTTP debugger. if redirection occurs more than once the main
  URL was always told to be the last origin of the redirection.

- Dangerous proxy detection: A special proxy range wasn't tested, just added now.

- Dangerous proxy detection: It wasn't launched if you did a proxy dup removal before.



What's new in v4.95 (3618)  Wed October-30-2002
==========================

- Bug fixed with the proxy anonymity  analyzer. Symptow was that gateways weren't
  shown. In fact they were shown but too fast for the eyes to catch. then replaced
  by "OK it seems to work" replies. (Visual bug)

- Added an option in \progression\redirs tab, to choose what to import into history.
  Choose to import the original URL, or the redirected urls. 

- Added a new tab in the settings section to allow more visibility. The Misc tab was
  too saturated.

- I've updated the default PJ list (5 entries removed)

- Added an option to shutdown your computer after a test completion or full job list 
  completion. Be aware that stopping manually a test when that option is on, would
  stop your machine also. Use it at your own risks.

- As you have seen, I'm introducing a new tool with Accessdiver : GhostSurf. That's not 
  my piece of code, but it can be a good companion to AccessDiver: protects your 
  privacy, remove popup ads, remove spywares etc... don't hesitate to give it a try :-)




What's new in v4.94+ (3565)  Fri September-27-2002
==========================

- Fixed an anoying option handling within the PJ script tester.
  Msg "Can't start anonymity checking. No workin PJ!" msg was
  thrown innacurately.
  I recommend you to tick the popup option called :
  
  "Verify ProxyJudge scripts before running an anonimity test (recommended)"

  It's in the Proxy Analyzer\ProxyJudges section. Right-click the list to set it.




What's new in v4.94 (3561)  Tue September-24-2002
==========================

- Oops, the Anonymity tester didn't work anymore within v4.93 due to the PJ area. I changed
  nothing in that area, but a uggly c++ code optimization made havoc there. Now it works
  don't ask me why  ?!!?   :)

- A User suggested to stop the anoying alerts on clipboard operations. Now you have the choice
  to keep them or not. Go in \Settings\Misc\Auto-Clipboard.

- Bug when opening a login or a url into your navigator. It was opened unfocused. Sorry, it was 
  due to the new bannerware system.

- I've removed by mistake the option to choose to check PJ scripts before an anonimity. It's just
  back whe it should be: Right-click in the PJ list to see it. :)

- An anoying bug fixed. When a proxy was said "PJ uncheckable", and when changing the PJ script 
  to try, [Accuracy] column wasn't update and would put you in a uncertain case. Good or not 
  Good proxy. IT's ok now, in that case the [Accuracy] value = "OK - it seems to work"

- Fixed a bug (not 100% sure): the delay info of PJ scripts sometimes could be changed with an "OK"

- Added a much needed stuff: a STOP button in the PJ script tester. See at bottom when starting!!!




 
What's new in v4.93 (3537)  Sun September-22-2002
==========================
 
- Fake detector was a bit slowly in its step 3/3. Now it runs faster!

- ProxyJudge list updated. Based on the 09-14-02 post of lorissa@deny 
  (less 2 dead ones).

- Added a delay information in the proxyjudge list to see how fast a script can be.

- Added sort functions : 'by speed' & 'by name' to sort your proxyjudge list

- Fixed a bug when quitting AD. The state (OK/BAD) of PJs weren't saved correctly.

- Added an option to choose to test PJs with or without the current proxy in AD. in
  v4.92 and below, AD always tried a verified a PJ by using a proxy. So if the proxy
  was dead, you could get get false results.

- By default PJ scanning doesn't use any proxy except if asked to. right-click the
  PJ list to set that.

- Bug fixed when PJ script detection was done. Some scripts could be missed. it Works 
  good now. No more PJ script skipped. :)

- Bannerware system updated. Thank you for visiting my sponsors when you have time. :)





What's new in v4.92 (3490)  Wed August-7-2002
==========================
 
- Now AccessDiver handles international character sets (russian, chinese,...) so that you 
  will not have text cutoffs when using the software. See in \settings\Audio&language area. 

- A bad bug could occur when storing proxy info in history comment area. That could kill 
  your history content when dealing on particular IPs (=unreadable lines). That's a rare 
  case but I recommand you to update if you don't want to loose content. :)  

- "What to do with found logins" option in \settings\search didn't save the wordlist just
  after the end of the scan. You would have to do it by yourself to keep the logins. Now 
  you don't need to , it's saved automatically. 

- When adding all redirections from \progression\menu, it should store the real URL instead 
  of the redirected url. 

- Added a notification option in the exploiter. The exploiter won't start if it finds content 
  in exploit history for the current URL. suggested @deny. 

- Added an option in HTTP debugger to get the cookie stored for a particular URL. 





What's new in v4.91 (3472)   Sat. July-20-2002
==========================

- Serious bug fixed in fake detector. A logical test was wrong.

- Deeper fake detection (3steps engine)

- The popup menu in proxyanalyzer "add selection..." was disabled

- HTTP debugger handles now the "file://" protocol for previewing

- Bug fixed when importing a combo with white spaces. "the good:days" was 
  handled as user="the" pass="good:days"

- Adding from proxy analyzer to proxy list was done up side down. Fixed!!! (lightson)

- In Exploiter the option "403 are hits" wasn't used, but "Redirs are hits" was used instead.

- Added a PAUSE function in the progression tab. (user suggestion)

- When AD finds weak logins, in some cases the 2XX stat wasn't updated. fixed!





What's new in v4.90 (3450)   Tue. Jun-25-2002
==========================

- Bot kernel updated, should fix some described fake problems.

- Function "Detect a subdir in redirection=weak login" wasn't handled in FORM scanner. Just fixed!

- Exploiter section as 2 new options: "Redirs are hits" and "403 are hits". That can be good in 
  some cases. (MeBigGuy) These 2 options can be saved in your snapshots.

- Bug when importing a text file exploit list. It was havoc there. just fixed.

- full urls with emails could make problems when opening them in your navigator. Now AccessDiver 
  replaces '@' by %40. that allow access with full urls.

- Visual changes in Icons (Save and Load icons)  (lightson)

- Bug when installing AD on a new machine. Fixed the msg saying "can't init registry".

- Detecting POST data in \settings\htmlsettings now can let you set a referer value. (user suggestion).


  


What's new in v4.90 (3428)   Sun. Jun-02-2002
==========================

- Build 3423 was running with 70Bots max, oops. just fixed

- Added a feature in proxy analyzer to remove FBI & US army open proxies. In case you don't want 
  to stick with them.

- Added a final fixup in the build 3423 for the anonymity correction (Tiscali like ISP)



What's new in v4.90 (3423)   Thu. May-31-2002
==========================

- Bad potential freezing bug found and fixed within the [Standard] scanner. That fix Should also 
  increase the speed per hour a bit and reduce the timeouts a bit also. So more tests at once:-)  

- Bad bug when testing anonymity of proxies. Some ISP can return false results. Fixed!!!

- Added a more robust fake handler. A bit slower but goes deeper in the test. :)

- Fake redirection detector enhanced. You can tell from all the redirs receive which one is real 
  or not. Tha can be handy in some cases.

- Added a function to use the selected proxy as your default InternetExplorer proxy (thanks to Madmax)

- Fixed a bug when importing exploits from a text file. It was impossible to load them in.

- Fixed a bad bug when removing dups from the jobs section

- Progression\Redirs functions are now available in the menu button of the progression section

- the whole DomainName seeker has been remove from Accessdiver.

- Now when new exploits are found a proxy info is added with them in the exploit history

- When adding proxies from proxyanalyzer to your list, they are now saved on top.

- Added a new way to store your weak logins. Send them into GeoWhere for a more accurate use :)
  Weak logins found can immediatly be sent in GeoWhere. GeoWhere 2.0 has a better login tester
  than the one in Accessdiver. And works at light speed. GeoWhere is almost ready for mid-june.

- I did other fixes but I don't remember since I lost the update txt I did for them. :-(
