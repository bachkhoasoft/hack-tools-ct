            save a ton of time on the shares, windoz and users scans. Check
            Single IP to give and IP address or computer name to scan. Examples:

    <td width="100%" valign="middle"><b>Other Info:<br>
      </b>Scanarator allows you to set the thread count fairly high but this is
      not always the desired thing to do. Play with the thread count, timeout
      and retires to get the correct settings for your current connection. On a
      LAN it is usually ok to just let it fly but not always. I have completely
      saturated my VPN/Firewall/NAT connection to a remote network because of
      too many threads.
      <p>The share grind is for Win9x only, NOT NT, and works on the shares that
      have password level security.</p>
      <p>In the Message Send portion of Scanarator you can use the /USERS to
      send a message to all users attached to your computer or you can use the
      /DOMAIN to send to the domain you are logged into, BUT you have to use the
      command line button in order for this to work.</td>
