The SMB Auditing Tool by patrik.karlsson@ixsecurity.com
--------------------------------------------------------

This a suite of SMB and Netbios programs.
The programs are:

smbserverscan	 - Scan networks for listening server services.

smbdumpusers     - Used to retrieve users from a Windows NT/2000 box.
		   If verbose is used in combination with the Sid to User
		   mode, the RIDS of all users will be displayed aswell.

smbgetserverinfo - Returns some information from the ipaddress supplied.

smbbf 		 - A SMB bruteforcer which tries approx. 1200 logins/sec
		   on Windows 2000 because of the timeout bug. On NT4 it's
		   very much slower making a couple logins a sec.

		   If you run smbbf with only the ip specified, it will
		   attemt to retrieve all users, and try to login with a
		   blank password, followed by the username, in lowercase
		   as password and finally with the password "password".

		   If smbbf successfully logs in to an account, it will
		   continue with the next account.

		   If you feel that you want to take some precautions to
		   not disable every account on the server, try the -g flag.
		   After it locks out the first account, it stops at tries-1,
		   on the next account, and will not process the rest of the
		   password file. This is done on every account following the
		   locked out one. 

		   Bare in mind that if eg. the lockout is set to 3 tries, 
		   some user has done 2 "bad logins", it will seem to smbbf 
		   that the lockout is set to 1. Therefore its recommended
		   to keep the password list smaller than the lockout number,
		   and not to use the -g flag if not absolutely nessesary.

		   The administrator account doesn't seem to return the error
		   "account locked out", so the next available account will
		   be the one that will be monitored for lockout attempts.

Password files:
---------------
The password files can contain some magic stuff, such as:

%username%
uc %username%
lc %username%
uc %hostname%
lc %hostname%

The %username% means that we should try to login using the username as
password. The lc prefix is used for conversion to lowercase and the uc 
to uppercase.

The lc %hostname% and uc %hostname% tries to log in as the servers name,
in lower/upper case.

A blank line, tells the program to login using a blank password.
